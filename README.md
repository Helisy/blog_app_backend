This API was developed as a backend implementation for a blogging platform. It incorporates field validation in user inputs, as well as access token validation, ensuring the security and privacy of posts. In this project, it is possible to create posts, comment on posts, share posts from other users, and like them. Users have the ability to follow other users, allowing them to view the most recent posts from these users in their feeds.
